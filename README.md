  - Each donation associated with (donorId).
- **Cause - Donation Relationship (one-to-many relationship)**:
  - A cause can receive multiple donations through (donationId) foreign key.
  - Each Donation associated with causeId.
- **Admin/Volunteer - BlogPost Relationship (one-to-many relationship)**:
